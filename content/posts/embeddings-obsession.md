1. What is a BiDirectional LSTM?
2. When training for sentiment analysis, how does one consider the threshold of negative to positive? IMDB kerns.
3. When given a function mapping 0 to 1, what is the best way to map the outputs of this function to a function mapping 0 to 1 such that the distribution of the data is somehow spread uniformly on that interval?
4. 


Analogies:
 - Embedding is a compressed representation of data
 - Embeddings are coordinates on a map, lead you to think about clustering
 - Useful interface between teams in a company

Tradeoff:
 - simple distance measures requires high-dimensional representations
 - complex distance measures can work for low-dimensional representations

UMAP

Embeddings are a vector and a metric.

- embeddings are great for building autonomy

If you're an engineer and you're 

Embeddings build autonomy.
Embeddings build trust.

Umap is amazing useful at building trust.
Maps are some of the most visually compelling things you can produce.

Takes a lot of effort to connect two very deep domains that are otherwise very disparate.
