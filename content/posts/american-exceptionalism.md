We are the exception. We have people that speak up when there's something to be said.

We limit the control our leaders have. We have checks and balances.

If you're looking for an authoritarian regime, look elsewhere.

Are we destined to become authoritarian? We are still young, as a nation.

Is it the natural progression?
