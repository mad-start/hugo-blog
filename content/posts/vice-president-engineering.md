How to become a startup VPE with Martin Casado?

Number 1 mistake: not taking the role seriously.
Many startups don't take it seriously
There's not one organization model that works.
There's not one definition of VP engineering that works.

So often startups view role as overhead role. 
There is not clarity on:
CTO
VP Engineering
Engineering Leader
Engineer Manager

What normally happens in a startup.... is:
 - hire some engineers
 - total mess
 - somebody needs to be a leader
 - look around the room
 - make someone vp engineering
 - doesn't know how to recruit
 - doesn't know how to hire
 - becomes total mess in 6-12-18 months

Martin Casado recommends:
 - find those stone cold VP engineers learned and shipped on somebody else's dime
 - set process
 - hiring difficult
 - culture
 - deadlines
 - people management
 - do things that engineers do not know how to do

You could build this from within, or you could just get someone like this.

Martin Casado says most common questions I get from early founders is How do I vet.

Fundamental cultural things: militaries vs communes.


Way better to evaluate team than a person.
throughput of their team is the best way to evaluate a VP of Engineering


Experience in a large company and a startup.

Can a VP Engineer be a crappy engineer?

Someone who is deeply passionate about a specific technology or approach is very damaging to the team.

VP Engineers are not good when they were too opinionated about implementation details


2 things hard to simultaneously do:
 - Ship code. 
 - Create a thriving team.

Boxes vs Archetype
