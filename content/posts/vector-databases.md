So I started learning about vector databases last week and got super excited. 

I have a few questions:
 - How do I build embeddings?
 - Are standard distance metrics preferable (i.e. dot product, cosine, euclidean)?
 - How do I build _meaningful_ embeddings?
 - How do I build _meaningful_ embeddings across modalities?
 - What is an appropriate distance metric when thinking about a nearest neighbor search?
What are the limitations of neareest neighbor search, what is necessary for it to scale?
 - Is there a single approximate nearest neighbors algorithm that works for everyone?
 - What are efficient ways to train embeddings?
 - I have been hearing about vector databases.... what is the difference between them?

#### Man it's crowded in here!
