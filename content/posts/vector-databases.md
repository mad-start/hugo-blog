So I started learning about vector databases last week and got super excited. 

How do I build embeddings?
How do I build _meaningful_ embeddings?
What is an appropriate distance metric when thinking about a nearest neighbor search?
What are the limitations of neareest neighbor search, what is necessary for it to scale?
What are efficient ways to capture embeddings?
I have been hearing about vector databases.... what is the difference between these?

Man it's crowded in here.
