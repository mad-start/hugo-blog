    <p>How to become a startup VPE with Martin Casado?</p>
<p>Number 1 mistake: not taking the role seriously.
Many startups don&rsquo;t take it seriously
There&rsquo;s not one organization model that works.
There&rsquo;s not one definition of VP engineering that works.</p>
<p>So often startups view role as overhead role.
There is not clarity on:
CTO
VP Engineering
Engineering Leader
Engineer Manager</p>
<p>What normally happens in a startup&hellip;. is:</p>
<ul>
<li>hire some engineers</li>
<li>total mess</li>
<li>somebody needs to be a leader</li>
<li>look around the room</li>
<li>make someone vp engineering</li>
<li>doesn&rsquo;t know how to recruit</li>
<li>doesn&rsquo;t know how to hire</li>
<li>becomes total mess in 6-12-18 months</li>
</ul>
<p>Martin Casado recommends:</p>
<ul>
<li>find those stone cold VP engineers learned and shipped on somebody else&rsquo;s dime</li>
<li>set process</li>
<li>hiring difficult</li>
<li>culture</li>
<li>deadlines</li>
<li>people management</li>
<li>do things that engineers do not know how to do</li>
</ul>
<p>You could build this from within, or you could just get someone like this.</p>
<p>Martin Casado says most common questions I get from early founders is How do I vet.</p>
<p>Fundamental cultural things: militaries vs communes.</p>
<p>Way better to evaluate team than a person.
throughput of their team is the best way to evaluate a VP of Engineering</p>
<p>Experience in a large company and a startup.</p>
<p>Can a VP Engineer be a crappy engineer?</p>
<p>Someone who is deeply passionate about a specific technology or approach is very damaging to the team.</p>
<p>VP Engineers are not good when they were too opinionated about implementation details</p>
<p>2 things hard to simultaneously do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ship code.</li>
<li>Create a thriving team.</li>
</ul>
<p>Boxes vs Archetype</p>
