The goal is to develop a useful predictive model to help triage these tickets.
Below, we describe a handful of techniques that are worth considering when building a binary model.
The main definition we will have is warm-start learning, as this is the category of techniques I will describe."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.95.0"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/blog.tartakovsky.org/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content="Warm Start Learning"><meta property="og:description" content="Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re training a text classification system, for example, to automatically classify support tickets into buckets, &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; and &ldquo;not urgent&rdquo;.

What characterizes these techniques is that they start with a pretrained language model, such as <a href=https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2>this one</a> from Microsoft (note, it happens to have been created from another pretrained model).</p><ol><li><p><strong>Full fine tuning</strong> Freeze none of the weights and simply run your speciic data through to, exactly like training a neural network on a binary classification task (eg. Use cross entropy loss, etc.). Read more about fine tuning <a href=https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training>here</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Partial fine tuning</strong> Freeze all of the weights except the second-to-last last layer, essentially running logistic regression on the embeddings produced.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nearest neighbor search</strong> Here don&rsquo;t run any training, 1) embed the result and 2) be ready to determine whether the majority of top-k, or top-k% nearest neighbors are &ldquo;urgent&rdquo;; if so, label them urgent. Of course a reasonable value for k needs to exist, Could simply be k=1 to start.</p></li></ol><p>In this post, I will describe a handful of techniques, with minimal commentary.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=blog.tartakovsky.org>&copy; Steven's Blog 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
